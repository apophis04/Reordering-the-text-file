## Data File Rearranger

This simple Python script reads an input text file (`data.txt`), which contains serialized data, and rearranges it based on a predefined order. The output is saved to a new text file (`converted.txt`). The expected format of the input file is serial numbers followed by key-value pairs.

### How to Use:

1. Ensure you have a file named `data.txt` in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the script.
3. The rearranged data will be saved in a file named `converted.txt`.

### Customization:

- Adjust the `order` list to define the desired order of key-value pairs.
- The script expects a specific format for input data, so ensure your input file follows the required structure.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions for improvement!
